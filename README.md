<h1 align="center">Welcome to Comic translate </h1>

## Overview
This is a Python project in which I will use OpenCV and pytesseract to process a comic image and detect text within it. In the future, I will trying to incorporate OpenAI api to translate into different language.

## Features

 - [x] Incorporate OPenCV, Pytesseract and Pillow library
 - [x] Extract the detected text into a .txt file
 - [ ] Enhanced text detection capabilities
 - [ ] Translate language wiht OpenAI api or other dependencies
 - [ ] Paste translated languaged into original image file



## Usage
1. Clone this project locally
2. Run `pip install python` in your base / command line
3. Run `pip install opencv-python` in your base / command line
4. Run `python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow` in your base / command line
5. For the Tesseract library, there will be more steps involved in terms of installing it.
   1. Go to https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html
